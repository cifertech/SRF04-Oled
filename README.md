# SRF04-Oled
Using the SRF rangefinder module setup, we will calculate the distance and display it in the Arduino IDE software monitor series.

### What it DO!
Using the SRF04 rangefinder module, an OLED display as well as the ESP8266 board, we built a rangefinder device that operates according to the metric standard and has a accuracy of one centimeter. You can have many uses for this project due to the comprehensiveness of the training application and it is also worth mentioning that due to the basic code, this code can be used in other projects as well.

### Items needed
-SRF04
-ESP8266
-Oled 0.96

### Required libraries
-Adafruit SSD1306
-Adafruit GFX

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, using the SRF04 rangefinder module, an OLED display as well as the ESP8266 board, we have built a rangefinder device that works according to the metric standard and an accuracy of one centimeter. You can have many uses for this project due to the comprehensiveness of the training application and it is also worth mentioning that due to the basic code, this code can be used in other projects as well.
